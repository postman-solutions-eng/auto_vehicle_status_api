# auto_vehicle_status_api
Performance Motor's Vehicle Status API allows users to get up-to-the-minute status updates on many elements of PM-integrated cars.

## Getting Started
We recommend starting in the `APIs` tab on the left vertical sidebar. Here, you can see the different APIs that are built by PM developers, as well as browse the API specifications. Once you are on the `Define` tab of an individual API, you will be able to see the associated resources (Documentation, Tests, Mock Servers, etc.), and navigate between the different API versions. 

Over in the `Collections` view, you will notice that each request has an example response associated with it. By calling the mock server endpoint (just the base url replaced with one generated by Postman's mock server generator), you will be able to access these sample responses without going through the registration/authentication process.

We've also included a visualizer dashboard which you can find on the `Complete Status` request. Try sending the request a few times and see the different error lights come on.

## Authentication
To get started testing the API, you will need to create a developer account in the PM Developer Portal. There, you will be issued an API key to use. This is to be kept confidential and not published or shared with other developers. You may store this key at any level of the Postman app: (collection, environment, or global variable fields), just make sure to only store it in the `current` column, as those values are only stored locally, and any data in the `initial` field will be synced with the cloud and could be exposed to others using your workspace.


## Associated Resources
- There is an **OpenAPI file** that was used to generate this collection, which you can find in the "APIs" tab on the left vertical sidebar. As the API itself evolves, we will use the two-way git sync to update the spec from Bitbucket to Postman, and thus translate those changes over to this documentation collection. 
  - Be sure to check back to this collection before you start implementing, and click the Watch icon on the API to be alerted to any changes
- **Monitor**: Under the Monitors tab on the same vertical toolbar, we have set up a monitor that runs the collection once a day and displays the results of the tests. 
- **Mock Server**: As this API is liable to expose sensitive information, we have set up a mock server to return example responses. You can still send the requests, just make sure the `baseUrl` variable is filled in with the monitor url to receive a response.
